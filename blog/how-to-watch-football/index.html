<h1 id="1-dont-watch-the-ball">1. Dont watch the ball</h1>
<p>IN AN AVERAGE FOOTBALL GAME, AN AVERAGE FOOTBALL PLAYER WILL GET 4.6% OF THE TOTAL TOUCHES OF THE BALL. THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT SIXTY TOUCHES PER GAME IN A RECENT PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON. IT FOLLOWS THAT, FOR CLOSE TO 86 MINUTES OF THE GAME, MOST PLAYERS ARE WITHOUT THE BALL. As football fans, we're taught to follow the action; to watch the  ball and the player who possesses it. It's the obvious and most entertaining choice. But the ball and the possessor are just the tip of the iceberg. This is because for the 86 minutes that your average player is not in possession of the ball, they aren't just standing still. They are moving, pressing, marking and repositioning themselves. In other words, affecting the game. It is in these moments that football mostly happens, and yet as viewers we miss almost all of it. 4 MINUTES ON THE BALL PER GAME! Maybe no player better illustrates this than Xavi Hern√°ndez, Barcelona's great playmaker. Xavi is - understandably - remembered for his ability to distribute the ball, and yet it was often his ability to receive it, to find space and make himself available for teammates to pass to that really enabled him to orchestrate games.</p>
<p>In a career of profound influence, Xavi's best performance might have been in the 2011 Champions League final, against Manchester United at Wembley. Of the 922 touches Barcelona had that night, Xavi accounted for 156 of them - an extraordinary level of involvement: 17% of his side's total and 11% of the game's. Those who just watched Xavi whenever he had the ball would have seen some beautiful and game-changing moments. But those who watched him for the full 90 minutes would have witnessed the real breadth of his authority - how he moved into space to make himself available to receive passes, how he dropped into position to cover defensively, and how he was continuously scanning the play and plotting where his next pass would go, even before he was given the ball.</p>
<p>IF HE HAD 156 TOUCHES, IT'S BECAUSE HE MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE 156 TIMES.</p>

<p>BACK IN 1863, A FOOTBALL PITCH WAS A BLANK CANVAS. THERE WERE NO MARKINGS TO SPEAK OF. THERE WERE GOALPOSTS, ALBEIT WITHOUT CROSSBARS, AND FLAGS THAT MADKED OUT THE CORNERS, BUT THE PITCH BORE LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT IT WOULD BECOME. Its metamorphosis wouldn't begin until 1891, when goallines and touchlines around the perimeter were added, and the centre circle was introduced. A goalkeeper's area became part of the game too, although in the form of two half circles originating at each goalline. The precursor to the penalty spot was also introduced though, again, not in a recognizable way. The original penalty spot was actually a line twelve yards from the goalline, which stretched right the way across the breadth of the pitch. IT WOULDN'T BE UNTIL 1902 THAT THE MODERN PITCH REALLY TOOK SHAPE. The penalty line finally became a spot. The penalty area took on its rectangular form. The halfway line was added, too, cutting through the centre circle at a point equidistant from each goal. AND THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ONE MORE CHANGE:  THE PENALTY -AREA ARC, WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN 1937.</p>
<p>The D, as it's better known, is an iconic part of a football pitch's visual identity, and it has a very simple purpose. It's there to prevent encroachment when a penalty is being taken. When a penalty is taken, every player apart from the taker must be outside the penalty area and at least ten yards away from the ball. The problem, prior to the D's introduction, was that it was very difficult for referees to judge any encroachment. The D changed that.</p>

<h1 id="3-if-you-don-t-know-maybe-no-one-does-the-answer">3. IF YOU DON'T KNOW MAYBE NO ONE DOES THE ANSWER</h1>
<p>People think of football as an English game, but it has diverse roots. Forms of the game were played by the Chinese in around AD 200, and the Aztecs developed a similar sport, too. In Italy, the game's ancestor is Calcio Fiorentino, a brutal sport originating in the Middle Ages, which to the modern eye looks closer to mixed martial arts, religious ceremony and rugby than to modern football.</p>
<p>In England, football dates from the eighth century. The aim of medieval 'mob' football was to transport an inflated pig's bladder from one end of a village to another by any means necessary. Injuries were common, deaths weren't unusual, and teams were often hundreds strong. It was chaos.</p>
<p>Medieval football is largely a thing of the past, though some forms do still exist, like the Atherstone Ball Game, which is played in the town of Atherstone, in Warwickshire, every Shrove Tuesday, between teams of indeterminate size. But it's a long way from the eleven-a-side game that we know today.</p>
<p>The journey from mob football to the modern game involved a few English public schools and plenty of compromise. The first laws - the Sheffield Rules were published in 1858. The newly formed Football Association published its own version in 1863 and, although those rules became universal in 1877 (the same year that tripping and hacking were outlawed and the goal-kick was introduced), there was no mention of team size - anywhere. Twenty years later, the International Football Association Board, which was formed to reconcile the differences in rules between the English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish Football Associations, and which is still the game's lawmaker to this day, wrote eleven players into the rules as one of its standardizing amendments. But that was hardly revolutionary; eleven players on each side had actually been the convention for the past few decades. So, how did that happen? It might just have been trial and error. Some think that, following the introduction of a goalkeeper in 1871, eleven players might have gradually become a norm, as an ideal number for the various roles on the pitch or the amount of space that needed filling. Another theory is attractive and very simple. Many British football clubs trace their origins back to cricket, with the sport serving as a means for cricketers to stay fit through the winter months. So maybe the eleven players of a cricket team naturally became eleven footballers - out of convenience, perhaps?</p>
<h1 id="4-most-rules-are-there-for-a-reason-the-evolution-of-the-offside-rule">4.MOST RULES ARE THERE FOR A REASON (The evolution of the offside rule)</h1>
<p>FROM THEIR INTRODUCTION, MOST OF FOOTBALL'S LAWS WERE TWEAKED AND REFINED TO IMPROVE THE GAME. THE OFFSIDE RULE IS NO DIFFERENT. TODAY, THE DEFINITION OF OFFSIDE IS SIMPLE: AT THE MOMENT AT WHICH A PASS IS PLAYED, AN ATTACKING PLAYER IN THE OPPOSITION'S HALF MUST EITHER BE BEHIND OR LEVEL WITH THE BALL, OR OTHERWISE HAVE TWO OPPOSING PLAYERS BETWEEN THEM AND THE GOAL THAT THEY'RE ATTACKING.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2023-09-14-12-39-32.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It's a finely balanced rule that seems fair to both the attacking and the defending players. That hasn't always been the case, though. In fact, while almost untouched now for nearly a century, the offside laws have undergone many revisions. In the original Football Association rulebook, a player was offside if they were in front of the ball when it was kicked. No ifs, buts or maybes; it didn't even matter whether or not that player was receiving a pass.</p>
<p>That didn't really encourage a passing game or very many goals. The intention had been to prevent goal-hanging (loitering around the opposition's goal), but the consequence was to create a low-scoring, dour spectacle. So, in 1866, the first revision was introduced, making it a rule that a player would be onside either if they were behind the ball when it was kicked or if there were three opposition players between them and the goal they were attacking. One of those players was typically the goalkeeper, but it still encouraged very cautious football. In 1903, the idea of 'interfering with play' was introduced, which created a grey area in the laws that still exists to this day. It meant that if a player wasn't involved in, or affecting, the play, then there would be no offside.</p>
<p>In 1925, again in pursuit of a more attacking game, the number of defenders needed between an attacking player and the goal was reduced from three to two, and that was very much the magic formula; from that moment, the offside law has remained relatively unchanged. Slight tweaks have been made, however. After the 1990 World Cup, for instance, it was determined that players could be level with defenders and remain onside. That was another measure to favour the attacking team. Then, at the beginning of the twenty- first century, it was decreed that a player could only be offside if a part of their body with which a goal could be scored had crossed the offside line. And so it has remained. The only innovations relating to offside since have concerned how it's adiudicated and the impact of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), which was introduced to provide technical oversight over refereeing decisions. Maybe that'll inspire a future tweak? The more technology has allowed officials to be precise, the more pedantic offside decisions have become - and perhaps that's counter to the spirit of the game?</p>
<h1 id="understand-formations-what-the-numbers-and-shapes-actually-mean">UNDERSTAND FORMATIONS(What the numbers and shapes actually mean)</h1>
<p>A FORMATION IS A JIGSAW; IT ONLY MAKES SENSE IF THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES FIT TOGETHER AND ARE ASSEMBLED CORRECTLY. A COACH HAS TO FIND A FORMATION THAT SUITS THE ABILITIES OF THE PLAVERS AVAILABLE, BUT ALSO THWARTS THE THREATS AND CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE OPPOSITION. EVERY FORMATION IS A COMPROMISE OF STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.</p>
<p>For instance, the traditional 4-4-2, with its four defenders, four midfielders and two forwards, is evenly spaced, secure and has a simplicity that makes it easy for most players to master; but it has its flaws. The positions are rigid, and that's a factor exploited by many modern managers who prefer a three-player central midfield, in the form either of a 3-5-2 or a 4-3-3.</p>
<p>Facing those teams, a side in a 4-4-2 and a pair of wingers each side, will often formation, with two central midfielders find itself at a numerical disadvantage in the middle of the pitch and face difficulty in retaining and advancing possession.
<img src="/images/2023-09-14-12-48-21.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/2023-09-14-12-50-07.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Equally, though, despite the advantages of a system like 3-5-2, in which an extra midfield player is available, there will always be an issue to overcome somewhere else. Playing one defender fewer means allowing the opposition more space up front; it also requires a centre forward of unusual size and ability, who can play with only wingers for support rather than an actual partner, or second forward. There's no right answer; every team comprises different players with unique strengths and weaknesses, and there's no such thing as a system that works equally well for everyone. Moreover, because of the way football evolves and player 'types' are always falling in and out of fashion, what works today might not be quite as optimal in ten years' time. At the dawn of the Premier League, for instance, back in the 1990s, almost every team in the top-flight played 4-4-2 with two strikers in attack, usually of contrasting and complementary abilities. Within a decade, the trend had moved towards 4-3-3, with those two strikers being replaced by one centre forward, and the wingers from the 4-4-2 being recast as wide forwards either side of that one player.</p>
<p>FORMATIONS ARE A RESPONSE - TO STRENGTHS, TO WEAKNESSES, AND TO THE FOOTBALL FASHIONS OF THE DAY.</p>
<h1 id="know-your-influences">KNOW YOUR INFLUENCES</h1>
<p>HERBERT CHAPMAN WASN'T SO MUCH AN INFLUENCE ON FOOTBALL AS ONE OF ITS PIONEERS.
WHILE A MANAGER, CHAPMAN WON THE FIRST DIVISION FOUR TIMES - TWICE WITH HUDDERSFIELD AND TWICE WITH ARSENAL - AND HE LED BOTH CLUBS TO WIN THE FA CUP.</p>
<p>When the offside rule changed in 1925, it allowed a forward to be played onside by two defenders instead of three, encouraging teams to play a more attacking game and to commit greater numbers forward. Chapman's W-M (or 3-2-2-3) formation was a response to that. It converted the centre half in back at the heart of a back three - thus its predecessor, the 2-3-5, into a centre providing greater defensive protection. It was the basis of Chapman's successful Arsenal sides of the early 1930s and their hugely effective style of play. During an era in which there was little tactical cohesion between players, <img src="/images/2023-09-14-13-16-49.png" alt="" /> He was the author of all sorts of other changes, too, and the source of a raft of different ideas, many of which remain in the game today. Arsenal's shirts have white sleeves, for instance, because he thought it would make it easier for his players to spot their teammates. It was his idea that football shirts should be numbered, that floodlights should be installed at Highbury, and that tactics could be used to explain players' roles in team meetings. Even the idea of discussing tactics at all was new, as was the idea in England that a system could win games. But his influence extended well beyond the chalkboard. He was behind London's Gillespie Road tube station being renamed 'Arsenal', and he was part of the club's decision to drop its &quot;the' prefix so that it would begin each season atop of the league table in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>HE ALSO REMADE HIS OWN ROLE. HIS PEERS, &quot;TRAINERS' REALLY, TASKED WITH PICKING THE OTHER COACHES OF THE TIME, WERE THE TEAM AND LITTLE ELSE. Chapman broke that mould. He was involved in scouting and reserve teams, long before that was typical, and he created training schedules, too. He was involved in almost everything - essentially, he defined the contemporary football manager decades before the concept existed. He exerted influence of a breadth that wouldn't become normal until many years after his untimely death in 1934.</p>
<p>The current league system in England is misleading. There are four professional divisions, of which the Premier League is the highest. Below that, in order, are the EFL (English Football League) Championship, the EFL League One and the EFL League Two. That's a fairly modern change, with the Premier League coming into being only in 1992. Before that, from its 1888 creation onwards, the ordering was simpler, with the First Division the highest, the Second Division below it and so on.</p>
<h1 id="learn-to-spot-thi-difference-zonal-marking-vs-player-marking">LEARN TO SPOT THI DIFFERENCE Zonal (marking vs player marking)</h1>
<p>When a football team is defending, they have two main ways to stop an opponent scoring goals. One is to disrupt the opponents' play directly by putting pressure on the player. The other way is to protect space and stop the opponent from advancing the ball into areas from where they could score. These two different approaches have led to two different types of defensive system: player marking (commonly known as man marking) and zonal marking.</p>
<p>In a player-marking system, a team will look to orientate itself defensively by marking - or getting close to - opposition plavers:
The benefits of player marking are that it offers an effective way of covering the opposition. Player-to- player pressure makes it hard for an opponent to construct moves, and there is clarity for the defending team as to what each individual's responsibility is. But it has its downsides: first and foremost, it requires a huge amount of physical exertion to follow an opponent around a pitch for 90 minutes. On top of that, the fact that defending players have to track opponents can mean that the opposition can pull the defending team's structure apart, creating space for other plavers to exploit.</p>
<p>ZONAL MARKING For these reasons, most teams will use a zonal-marking defensive system. Instead of marking players, the defending team are now covering 'zones' on the pitch: Defending the areas that they're responsible for prevents players from being dragged out of position with the same ease as in a player-marking system. But this system has its downsides, too. Oppositions can cause problems by overloading or switching zones, creating confusion for the defending team as to who is responsible for whom. NO PERFECT DEFENSIVE MARKING AS WITH FORMATIONS, THERE IS SYSTEM. EACH TEAM TAILORS THEIR APPROACH AROUND WHO THEY HAVE AVAILABLE AND WHAT KIND OF OPPOSITION THEY'RE FACING. SOMETIMES, THE ANSWER IS EVEN A COMBINATION OF THE TWO: PLAYER MARKING A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS PLAVER, WHILE ADOPTING A MORE ZONAL STRATEGY ACROSS THE REST OF THE DITCH.</p>
<h1 id="a-player-s-role-matters-more-than-their-position-how-a-team-is-built">A PLAYER'S ROLE MATTERS MORE THAN THEIR POSITION (How a team is built)</h1>
<p>Formations.
The bedrock of modern football. The humble 4-4-2. The fashionable 3-4-3. These numbers represent positions, and we give these positions names that indicate where each player probably spends most of their time on the pitch, like 'centre back' or 'defensive midfielder', or sometimes what their main job is, like 'striker' But, today, these labels are too simplistic. Compare three different full backs, each operating in a back- four defence. One might stav deep allowing the opposite full back to push high and creating a back-three shape. One might push very high in attack, trying to overlap and beat their opposite number to whip in crosses. And one might tuck into central midfield.</p>
<p>Or, put simply: Arsenal's Takehiro Tomiyasu, Aston Villa's Matty Cash, and Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold, for example. They're all full backs', but their roles are very different. Positions create expectations for someone watching fortball but the complexity and tactical nuances of the modern game mean that they   are just a starting point. No two central midfielders do exactly the same job, even it they mostly stay in the same part of the pitch. One might pass expressively and take risks with the ball to create chances; another may just tackle, win the ball back, and play simple, short passes to the closest teammate.</p>
<p>WHEN WE THINK BE THINKING ABOUT THEN, WE SHOULD ABOUT PLAYERS, ROLES.ARE THEY THE CREATIVE HUB, DESDITE BEING A FULL BACK? WHAT DOES THIS PLAYER ACTUALLY DO FOR THEIR TEAM?DOES THIS STRIKER LURK ON THE SHOULDER TO RUN IN BEHIND, OR DROP DEEP TO ORCHESTRATE ATTACKING MOVES FOR QUICK WIDE ATTACKERS?</p>
<p><img src="/images/2023-09-14-13-38-15.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Rather than fix our expectations of what a player should be doing, it would be better to focus on what they actually are doing and how that works within the team. Forget positions; look at roles.</p>
<h1 id="don-t-run-in-training-the-rise-of-tactical-periodization">DON'T RUN IN TRAINING (The rise of tactical periodization)</h1>
<p>WELL, DON'T RUN AIMLESSLY. conditioning included long, exhausting runs. And this was accepted as good A decade or two ago, most accounts of pre-season training or general practice. Go back a century, and you'll find that running was often the only preparation done ahead of matches. Starve a player of the ball during the week, and they were more likely to want it at the weekend - or so went the wisdom of the day. But, now, the idea that fitness and football are separate and cannot be worked on simultaneously has been disproven. Enter tactical periodization (or a small element of it, at least): the footballing pedagogy famously embraced by the likes of Jos√© Mourinho and Andr√© Villas-Boas.</p>
<p>Tactical periodization roots the training the game's governing dynamic. Fitness, framework in tactics, which is seen as technique, even psychology, are therefore all trained within that context. Sessions are planned around a rolling schedule that builds up towards games and takes the season's ebb and flow into account, so that, while every discipline is covered, the order and intensity of sessions are devised to fit the actual footballing calendar, and to guard against fatigue.</p>
<p>Building on the tenets of the Portuguese academic Vitor Frade, Mourinho trains his players in scenarios designed to mimic phases of the game: attacking, defending, transition from attacking to defending, and transition from defending to attacking. Tactical periodization is obviously much more complicated than just training with the ball at your feet, but that's a good place to start. Creating drills that mimic phases of the game ensures that running occurs within a proper, useful context and in a way that more accurately targets particular muscles, for example, and more efficiently trains certain disciplines. After all, while a 90-minute jog might be good preparation for an Olympic track athlete, running in a football match is very different. Players stop, start and change speeds and directions continuously, while performing a combination of tactical and technical tasks.
SO, DO RUN IN TRAINING, BUT DON'T RUN THE WRONG WAY.</p>
